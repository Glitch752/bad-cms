# bad-cms

### This branch is for converting to using a state machine.  
<br />
  
Basically what it sounds like. A bad content management system for developers.  
  
In the future, this app will let you create all kinds of sites, like blogs and portfolios.

## [ todo ]
- Change to a state machine for a better codebase, more readable code, and less bugs. [In progress - This branch]
