# Bad CMS for Devs

A bad content management system for developers.  
Honestly, the name doesn't even fully explain it. This application is intended to be the quickest and easiest way to create a website for people who have at least *some* development experience.
This application includes a visual layout editor for changing properties of elements, a node-based JavaScript editor for simple code editing (In progress), and a lot more to come.

## [ todo ]
- Make the visual layout editor easier to use
- Let the user organize the workspace
- Make the app more accessible
- Add multiple themes
- Finish the node-based Javascript editor

## Installing

To install, you can either use one of the provided installers in the releases, or you can download the application for the newest build and development.
### To download and run
`git clone master https://github.com/Glitch752/bad-cms.git badCMSforDevs`  
`cd badCMSforDevs`  
`npm install` (Will error, don't worry about it)  
`npm start`

## Contributing

Feedback is welcome! I would love for you to create an issue or pull request as long as the issue isn't already being fixed.  

## Compiling

If for some reason you want to compile the app into an installer, you can do it in the following way.
(Clone repo and run `npm install` first)  
`npm run package` (packages for your current platform)
