# Bad CMS for Devs

Basically what it sounds like. A bad content management system for developers.  
  
In the future, this app will let you create all kinds of sites, like blogs and portfolios.

## [ todo ]
- Make the visual layout editor easier to use
- Let the user organize the workspace
- Make the app more accessible
- Add multiple themes
- Add multiple languages / translations
- Visual node-based javascript editor???

## Installing

To install, you can either use one of the provided installers in the releases, or you can download the application for the newest build and development.
### To download and run
`git clone master https://github.com/Glitch752/bad-cms.git badCMSforDevs`  
`cd badCMSforDevs`

`npm start`

## Contributing

Feedback is welcome! I would love for you to create an issue or pull request as long as the issue isn't already being fixed.  

## Compiling

If for some reason you want to compile the app into an installer, you can do it in the following way.
(Clone repo and run `npm install` first)  
`npm run package` (packages for your current platform)
