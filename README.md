# Bad CMS for Devs

Basically what it sounds like. A bad content management system for developers.  
  
In the future, this app will let you create all kinds of sites, like blogs and portfolios.

## [ todo ]
- Create releases for the app [ in progress ]
- Work on the visual layout editor [ in progress ]
- Let the user organize the workspace
- Make the app more accessible
- Add multiple themes
- Add multiple languages / translations

## Installing

To install, you can either use one of the provided installers in the releases, or you can download the application for the newest build and development.
### To download and run
`git clone master https://github.com/Glitch752/bad-cms.git badCMSforDevs`  
`cd badCMSforDevs`  
`npm install` (Will error, don't worry about it)  
`npm start`

## Contributing

Feedback is welcome! I would love for you to create an issue or pull request as long as the issue isn't already being fixed.  

## Compiling

If for some reason you want to compile the app into an installer, you can do it in the following way.
(Clone repo and run `npm install` first)  
`npm run package` (packages for your current platform)  

Soon I will add commands to compile for a specific platform.
